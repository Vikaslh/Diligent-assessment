You are an AI developer assistant. Perform the following tasks step-by-step and generate all required code with comments:

### Step 1: Generate Synthetic E-Commerce Data
Create 5 synthetic CSV/JSON files representing a small e-commerce system:
1. customers.csv — (customer_id, name, email, city)
2. products.csv — (product_id, name, category, price)
3. orders.csv — (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
4. order_items.csv — (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity)
5. reviews.csv — (review_id, customer_id, product_id, rating, comment)

→ Generate around 20–30 records in each file with realistic synthetic data (random values, but consistent relationships).

### Step 2: Ingest Data into a SQLite Database
Write a Python script that:
- Creates a SQLite database (e.g., `ecom.db`).
- Creates tables corresponding to the above files.
- Reads each CSV/JSON file.
- Inserts all records into their respective tables.

Use libraries: `sqlite3`, `pandas` (optional), and `csv`.

### Step 3: Join and Query Data
Write another Python script (or SQL file) that:
- Runs SQL queries joining multiple tables (customers, orders, order_items, products, reviews).
- Example query: "List each customer's name, their total number of orders, and average product rating."
- Show meaningful output printed to the console.

### Step 4: GitHub Integration
Initialize a Git repository:
- Create a `README.md` explaining the project steps.
- Add and commit all files (data, scripts, and DB).
- Push to a GitHub repository.

### Additional Notes
- The project must run locally using Cursor IDE.
- Each file should be properly named and commented.
- Use relative paths for reading/writing files.
